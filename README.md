# **FOSview**

Welcome to the GitHub for the FOSview (Free and Open Source overView) [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/) Overview Pack. Here you will find instructions, how-to, and information on this Pack. For general and advanced Overview information, please see the following University Wiki articles:

- [Overview](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overview)
- [Overview Settings](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overview_settings)
- [Overview Manipulation](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overview_manipulation)

### **Installation:**

1. You can access your Overview Settings clicking the Hamburger Icon located on the upper left corner of your Overview and selecting Overview Settings. I also like to set "O" as a keyboard shortcut to open them, so I can even open them while docked.

2. Navigate to `Overview Settings > Misc` and click "Export Overview Settings" to create a backup of your current Overview. Name it something memorable.

3. Navigate to `Overview Settings > Misc` and click "Reset All Overview Settings."

4. Download the .yaml here and save to `%username%\Documents\EVE\Overview`, and then go to Overview Settings > Misc and click Import Overview Settings and select "BCTOR Overview" and make sure to click Check All before Import

5. Close Overview Settings and initiate a [Session Change](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Timers#Session_Change_Timer_.28SCT.29) (i.e. dock then undock)

6. Go to Overview Settings > Overview Tabs and set the colors you want for each tab in the dropdowns (my color choices are in the legend below). You must do this even if the tabs are already colored, it's merely a hold-over

7. Go to Overview Settings > Appearance and Toggle Also apply to structures to re-enable the Colortags ability to flash in the Chat Windows Member Lists (don't ask why, but it works)


### **Legend:**

- âœˆ - Travel tab, has zero ships on it (other than Trigs and Edencom), just used to more easily go from A to B

- Main - Default to here. You can pvp and do some light pve and travel

- ETC - Right click on this tab and use the Load Preset to Tab dropdown to swap between the "!" Overview Presets.
  - !Drones - Only Drones/Fighters
  - !Incursion - Cuts out the clutter while running Incursions
  - !Loot - Shows only wrecks/MTUs/Mobile Depots/Containers


- PvE - For ratting or site & mission running. Does not include wrecks or loot (use "!Loot" on the "ETC" tab for that, or add yourself if you wish)

- Friendly - Same as "Main" but with the States changed to show Friendly and Fleet and no one else

- Mining - Mining

- ALL - No, really

- GTFO - Tab here to get a warpout to save ship/pod and warp at 50-100


### **D-Scan:**

On your D-Scan window, click the Dropdown and select one of the following:
- ..D-Scan: All - Shows almost everything on D-Scan
- ..D-Scan: Defensive - Less clutter so you can see an incoming hunter
- ..D-Scan: Offensive - For the hunter, includes wrecks and a few other bits
